      <note xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3" type="public_message">THE wheat heads shown on the other side are av-erage heads of a 1913 Goose Lake wheat field. They are plump, long and filled to the end. A reasonable estimate of the yield per acre of this field would be at least 40 bushels. Any of the Goose Lake lands we are selling will do as well, as the soil is rich, heavy and deep. On the excursion of September 3rd, when the above mentioned heads were gathered, we had men from Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska with us. They all said they had never seen better land or crops and they backed up their opinion with their money by purchasing. We believe you would feel the same about this fine land when you saw it. Why not make up your mind to come with us on the trip leaving St. Paul Wednesday, September 17th. You will never get away unless you make up your mind to come and then come. We would like to have you with us. GODART LAND CO. ST. PAUL, MINN.</note>
