# Wax-workshop
Some resources for the [LEARN TOGETHER WAX WORKSHOP](https://accessconference.ca/workshops-and-hackfest/) at #AccessYEG on October 2, 2019

Time: 10:30 – 12:30 (free to join hackfest after)

Location: University of Alberta Libraries [Digital Scholarship Centre](https://dsc.library.ualberta.ca/), located on the 2nd floor of the Cameron Library

Interested in hands-on experience building digital exhibitions without writing code? The Access hackfest Wax workshop will provide space and time to dig into preparing data and setting up digital exhibitions from data to the final product using a lightweight, low barrier web-based tool. This workshop will be an informal “learn together” session so even if you are unfamiliar with using an interactive shell or Git/Github, there will be help with those parts. The hope is where we can try things out and explore while learning how Wax works and the ins and outs of creating digital exhibitions.

In this session we'll be using the WAX tutorial at https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/wax/ as our starting point.  

To set yourself up for the session you will need to have 

1. [a Github account](https://github.com/join)
2. Some knowledge of using an Bash Command Line (new this? Try starting with https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash tutorial)
3. Some [knowledge of markdown is helpful](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)
4. New to building static sites and Jekyll, try [this tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)


The session will be facilitated by Sarah Severson and Sam Popowich and there will be [prepared images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/182mVYK05ILDJzO36AcVgotncvPk0jLYS?usp=sharing) and [metadata](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EMNfoiMgMdei7I0LSW5yvGmIFgq2Yigp?usp=sharing) from the [University of Alberta Libraries Historical Postcard Collection](https://archive.org/details/albertapostcards)
