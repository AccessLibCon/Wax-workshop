You should see the grand display of native and tame grasses and also clovers and alfalfa. Vegetables do well there. If you are in-terested write to the Sec. Board of Trade, Granum, Alta.

,,,,,,"Toronto, Sept. 1908 Dear Folks I have just seen the Alberta Government exhibit at the Fair. Say! They must have a great province. Wheat goes as high as 60 bushels to the acre and from 30 to 40 is common. Oats yield from 40 to 100 bushel, and barley 30 to 50 bushel. You should see the unitation wheat field, the grand display of native and tame grasses and also clovers and alfalfa. Vegetables do well there, The climate is ideal for health. Coal is found in all parts of the Province. Coal oil and natural gas are also found there. If you are interested write to the Department of Agriculture, Edmonton or the Secretary of any Alberta Board  of Trade for literature With kind regards from Yours Sincerely",public_message,,,,,

Will you ask John Roblin to keep an eye on everything around the house especially the wagons on Sat. night """"Halloween"""" in case the kids get mischievious around there. It drizzled all day Sun. here and a howling snow storm on mtn. until into the afternoon when it cleared up. That put a stop to the threshing for a while I'm making a bureau scarf out of embroidered hand[?] + lace. I think it's going to be pretty. I knitted a lace which I intend to have around a doily and that bag I told you about and that's all I've done. Lazy, eh? Kind regards to all from us [?] and love to you from Your loving [Irma?]""",public_message,,,,,

,,Homesteading,,,,"Again this year, 1913, Canada has produced a fine crop. Did you ever stop to consider what a mag-nificent compliment to Canada is the fact that 675,000 Americans have settled in Canada in the last 7 years, and they've stayed there which must mean they are happy and prosperous for the American does not stay where he is not making good. Could you have better proof of Canada's goodness? We tell you that we confidently expect the land we are selling in the Goose Lake District, Saskatchewan will have a valuation of close to $100.00 per acre within in a few years. Our opinion is the same as that of many others who know this fine land and it is founded on a thorough acquaintance for a number of years. We believe you would have the same opinion if you saw it with us and if so it certainly offers you a splendid opportunity for profitable investment. We tell you this because we want you to come with us on our trip leaving St. Paul September 17th. We will give you a reduced rate and furnish good bed and board on our private car at a small price. If you purchase the trip costs you nothing. A fine trip to fine land showing the great 1913 Canadian harvest on the way. Can we make a fairer offer? Will you come? GODART LAND CO. ST.

,,Agriculture,,,,"THE wheat heads shown on the other side are av-erage heads of a 1913 Goose Lake wheat field. They are plump, long and filled to the end. A reasonable estimate of the yield per acre of this field would be at least 40 bushels. Any of the Goose Lake lands we are selling will do as well, as the soil is rich, heavy and deep. On the excursion of September 3rd, when the above mentioned heads were gathered, we had men from Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska with us. They all said they had never seen better land or crops and they backed up their opinion with their money by purchasing. We believe you would feel the same about this fine land when you saw it. Why not make up your mind to come with us on the trip leaving St. Paul Wednesday, September 17th. You will never get away unless you make up your mind to come and then come. We would like to have you with us. GODART LAND CO. ST. PAUL, MINN.",public_message,,,,,
